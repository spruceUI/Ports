UPDATE: Level 2, Halo, is live! This iconic level sets the tone for the rest of the game. It introduces new enemies, vehicles and weaponry in a semi-open world format that the player can explore as they choose. Double down in the fight against the Covenant in the second installment of Halo: Combat Devolved for the Game Boy Color.
On November 15, 2001, Bungie released its legendary first-person shooter for the original xBox. As a longtime fan of Halo: Combat Evolved, I 'm creating a faithful demake for the Game Boy Color using GB Studio.
I'm sharing a demo with the first level, the Pillar of Autumn and have plans to continue adding levels to the project as time allows. Can you blast through the hoards of Covenant boarders and escape the ship alive? What lies ahead on the mysterious ring formation?

As this game is currently, it contains 2 levels. The creator is still working on this game, and will likely add more levels later. Check the itch.io link below for any future updates.
