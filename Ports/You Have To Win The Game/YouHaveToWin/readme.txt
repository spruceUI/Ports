You Have to Win the Game C64 port

an exploration platformer with a retro 1980s PC aesthetic.

Run, jump, and avoid deadly pitfalls as you explore 
the ruins of a lost world in search of hidden treasures and rare artifacts!
Experience the thrill of four-color CGA graphics and monotonic PC speaker sounds! 

If you grew up in an age where dithering was a common graphical trick to get around color 
limitations and were excited when CGA was succeeded by EGA which gave way to VGA, just seeing 
a screenshot of Kyle Pittman's You Have to Win the Game will turn you mad with nostalgia.

The exploration platformer shares a lot of design elements with Terry Cavanagh's VVVVVV, 
Lyle in Cube Sector, and Celestial Mechanica, though its main trick is emulating the 
computing environment of a decades-old PC. But even if you don't get excited by 16-color 
CRT monitors, You Have to Win the Game is a thoroughly enjoyable ride!
