Videos and live streams are allowed. Monetization is allowed on gameplay videos only for the paid remake; kouri has forbidden making any form of profit from videos of the free version.
Do not modify, misappropriate, or redistribute any images or music from the game. In particular, do not reupload the music online, as it was made by others and is used in the game with permission.
Most fanworks are allowed, but creating fangames is not (sequels, offshoots, usage of the characters in general). Similarly, modification of the original game is not allowed (beyond the purposes of translation).
Fanworks can be sold only if kept to a "hobbyist" scope (this includes conventions). They should also not use the official logo nor pixel art from the game, or be easily mistaken for official merchandise.
