 -= HOW TO PLAY ON LINUX AND MAC =-
 ----------------------------------

Lavender has mainly been created and tested on Windows 7. 
However, playing it on Linux and Mac is definitely possible. 

Sadly, there is no way to do it without downloading other software. 


The following software can be used: 

 - Wine: https://www.winehq.org/
 - EasyRPG: https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/Player
 - RPGHub: https://rpgmaker.net/games/7635/


Using these comes with no warranties and no support from me, 
as it is not possible for me to test them and investigate any problems. 
However, they should run the game just fine.
