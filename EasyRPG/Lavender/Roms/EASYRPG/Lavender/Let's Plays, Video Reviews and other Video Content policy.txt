 -= LET'S PLAYS, VIDEO REVIEWS AND OTHER VIDEO CONTENT POLICY =- 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------

1. Let's plays, reviews, game streams, etc. are allowed and encouraged. 
2. Monetization is allowed through skippable ads, but not brand deals. 
   Also, please avoid mid-video ads where possible. 
3. Patreon, PayPal donations, etc. are fine. 
4. No monetized links to game pages or downloads are allowed. (e.g.: adf.ly, ouo.io, linkshrink.net)
5. Please link to http://rpgmaker.net/users/ClockworkPrince/ in every video's description. 


Not a rule, but a courtesy: 

If possible, please avoid jokes about rape and/or paedophilia. 
I personally find such humour distasteful and would prefer to not have my content associated
with it if possible. 


Please respect this policy when creating video content of this game. 

Thank you.
