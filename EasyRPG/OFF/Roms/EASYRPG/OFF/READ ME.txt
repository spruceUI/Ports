:::: OFF :::::
::  V.1.6.1   ::
:Translation V. 3.0:

Thank you for having downloaded OFF. All your comments, remarks, bug reports and criticisms are welcome. Don't hesitate to contact me directly to let me read them (check the "Contact" section at the end of this file).

INSTRUCTIONS

- Program -
To launch the game, double click the file named "RPG_RT.exe" in the game's main folder.
Once the game starts, press F4 to play in window mode.
Press F5 to change the window size.

If an error message appears, you'll have to download and install a program called RPG Maker 2003. It's not hard to use and you can easily create RPGs with it! It's quite easy to find it in French on the internet, but you'll have to download another program called the RTP, or else RPG Maker doesn't work properly. Make sure you have installed the 2003 version. Afterwards, try double-clicking the "RPG_RT.EXE" file again.

If that still doesn't work, I don't know what I can do for you. Go ask people who are more intelligent than I am (there are many of those) or try downloading the game to another computer.

- PLAYING THE GAME -
Use the arrow keys to move the main character (the Batter)
Use Enter or Space to interact with decorative elements or other characters
Use Esc or 0 (zero) to open the main menu and to go back through menus.
Use the F4 key to toggle between full-screen and windowed mode. Use F5 to change the size of the latter.

FAQ

Q : The font OFF is written in is unreadable.
A : Well that sucks, because I have done everything I could to solve this problem. Try installing "Profont.fon" into the "Fonts" folder of your computer.
[Translator's note: Due to the engine update OFF 3.0 runs in, this should no longer be an issue.]

Q : I don't understand the battle system ...
A : There's a tutorial available at the beginning of the game. If you still can't understand the system ... Hmmm... Go and ask for help at the Zanarkand forums (http://zanaforum.free.fr) or tinker with the system itself to figure it out.

Q : Can you access Alma?
A : Close this file and play to find out.

Q : I don't understand the story at all.
A : That's more or less normal. Things may become clearer to you as the game progresses, but I can't guarantee it.

Q : Are there any secret codes to unlock stuff?
A : There is one, namely this one: Down - Left - Up - Right - Z - J - B - D - B - Start.

Q : Will there be a sequel to OFF?
A : We are thinking about it.

Q : How do you unlock the secret ending?
A : *Whistle* *whistle*...

Q : What does FAQ, Q and A mean ?
A : FAQ means Funfair And Questions, Q means Question and A Answer.

Q : What does DARPA mean ?
A : Department of Armament Research and umm ... Well, something like that, I think. But this question has nothing to do with OFF anyway...

Q : Can I use your graphics resources?
A : (I don't think people would want to, but...) Help yourself. (If you do that, maybe think about putting my name into the credits of your game... please.) On the other hand, please avoid making games that are set in the same world as OFF. We have a backstory that we'd like to exploit to the core.

Q : Can I use your music in my game?
A : That's a more delicate issue. Contact Alias Conrad Coldwood first, please. (aliasconradcoldwood@gmail.com)

Q : About the music, I noticed that some of the loops aren't perfect...
A : Yak yak yaaaaaak! They are perfect! It's just that RPG Maker doesn't like us.

Q : I'm stuck ...
A : I wrote a complete walkthrough, which you can find here:
http://gaarabis.free.fr/_mortis/off/Soluce.txt
[Translator's note: This walkthrough is, unfortunately, in French. There is, however, a wonderful OFF walkthrough on the internet by jayisgames. Check it out here: https://jayisgames.com/review/off.php]

Q : Can't you see that French is a horrible language?
A : An English version is expected to arrive in the foreseeable future. Still, let me tell you that you have absolutely no taste. Information on the English version can be found here: 
http://www.rpg-maker.fr/index.php?page=forum&id=3910&deb=1
[Translator's note: If you are reading this file in English, then it's obvious that you're playing the English version. In fact, this is version 3.0 of said translation! It's been a long road, but we're finally here.]

Q : I have another question, but I'm afraid of getting in contact with you because you seem like a bizarre fellow.
R : I left my email address below. Don't hesitate to contact me. I'd be happy to answer your questions.
[Translator's note: Should you have any questions about the translation, or found bugs or typos in this build, my contact details can be found below as well! -RecDra]
