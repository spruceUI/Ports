The 2024 Expanded Edition of "The Mayor of Sanctuary" by Nara Makes Games, the one man studio that was established in Nara, Japan during the 2020 global pandemic. This game reflects my experience living in Nara for eleven months where I focused my life on all things fun/nostalgia (retro video games, anime, toys, etc).
